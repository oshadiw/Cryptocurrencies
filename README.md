# Cryptocurrencies

This project was conducted to summarize data about various cryptocurrencies. The data was processed and then used to report how the cryptocurrencies are traded on the market and also grouped toward creating a classification system for a new product. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such a PCA and K-means were used to reduce the dimensions and cluster the data. A 3D scatter plot was created to visualize the clusters.
